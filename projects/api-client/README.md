# ApiClient

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.4.
Read more about creating Angular libraries [here](https://angular.io/guide/creating-libraries).
Don't add any other code here, apart from updating the API client. The entire purpose of this library is to be a generated API client.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project api-client` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project api-client`.

> Note: Don't forget to add `--project api-client` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file.

## Build

Run `ng build api-client` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build api-client`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/api-client` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test api-client` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
