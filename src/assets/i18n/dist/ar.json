Cases are always displayed as pairs, the case with the earlier creation date being on top.<br/><br/>You can use the creation date filter to only view potential duplicates that were created in a specific time period. The creation date is automatically generated when a case is entered into SORMAS and can not be changed by users. Therefore, once you have reviewed all duplicates from a specific time period in the past, you will never have to do it again as there will be no new cases created during this time frame.<br/><br/>Please note that most likely not all displayed cases are actual duplicates. There is the potential for false positives, so <b>please thoroughly review the cases before merging them\\!</b> In addition to the information provided in the table, you can also click on the IDs of the cases to open them in a new tab.

This is only necessary if there are cases in the list that do not yet have a completeness value. Normally, this value is automatically updated whenever the details of a case or one of its contacts or samples change.","infoCaseCompleteness":"Completeness is a measurement of how much vital data has already been entered into the case. This is composed of the following, weighted by their importance\\:<br/><ul><li>Has the case been classified?</li><li>Has the case been investigated?</li><li>Has at least one sample been taken?</li><li>Has at least one symptom been documented?</li><li>Has at least one contact been created?</li><li>Is there an outcome for the case?</li><li>Does the case have a birth date or age?</li><li>Does the case have a sex?</li><li>Has an onset date been specified?</li></ul>","infoCompletenessMerge":"You can use this measurement to get an idea about which case you should use as the one that remains active when merging.
